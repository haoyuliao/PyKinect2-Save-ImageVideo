The two example codes show how to save the image and video formats such as png and mp4 by using PyKinect2 library. The credits of example codes are from the following authors:

1.PyKinect2

https://github.com/sxs4337/PyKinect2/tree/master/examples

2.Pykinect-Basics

Recommending steps to build environments before running codes:
1. Install Python 2.7
2. pip install PyKinect2
3. Go to PyKinect2 library (https://github.com/Kinect/PyKinect2), and downloading three files under the pykinect2 folder in that li.
4. Cover the files in step 2's folder (eg. ..Lib/site-packages/pykinect2).
5. pip install comtypes==1.1.4
6. pip install opencv-python==4.2.0.32

After building environments, you should be fine to run the examples.

Further suggestions, currently, the PyKinect2 doesn't update anymore, the python3 cannot run the PyKinect2's example codes. Thus, the above steps are built based on python2 with old libraries. It is recommended that PyKinect2 should be updated by python communities since PyKinect2 is the only easiest packages for operating Kinect2 devices.
